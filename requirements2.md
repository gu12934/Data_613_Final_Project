Some Questions to Ask Yourselves When Working on the Final Project:
Does our R code run? Are the packages specified using the library() function?
Is our code commented in a way that an instructor can understand what we did?
Have we made sure that all the variable names make sense? For example, if the project is on the
movie industry and we have a variable named airplaneCrashes_2017_df, then that makes no sense.
Have we satisfied the minimum requirements specified in the Structure of Questions section?
Have we scraped data from the web, used an API, or demonstrated some skill in terms of automated
data collection for at least one of our questions of interest?
Did we answer each of our six questions rigorously with statistical or decision-analytic tools we
either learned in this class, in another class, or on our own?
Did we create regression models for at least four of our questions?
Have we included data visualizations for at least three of our questions?
Does each visualization support the data story or provide an insight in some way? We do not want
to create arbitrary visualizations just to have them in the project, since that would distract from the
core insights of the project.
Overall, does our project demonstrate all three data skill categories specified in the guidelines?
Have we submitted all the required files (R files, Power BI files, Tableau files, data files, etc.)?
Did we ask ourselves other questions to ensure that we create and deliver a high-quality project?

Other Questions to Ask Yourselves
You need to develop the skill of coming up with your own questions to ask yourself to ensure a
high project quality, but to help you, some questions are provided here.
Is this all the data we need to collect to answer our questions, or is there something else we need?
Did we ensure that we cleaned the data before doing any analysis/visualization? When we
wrangled the data, transformed data types, transformed/combined columns in some way, did we
do it correctly? In particular, are we sure that our analysis is done on data that makes sense to us?
For example, when cleaning and wrangling the data, have we made sure that we have not made
mistakes such as analyzing a population column that suggests that the current population of Canada
is over 9000000000? This kind of a mistake has happened in prior projects, so please be very
careful when wrangling, filtering, and aggregating the data.
Is each visualization provided in the presentation and written report relevant to the question asked
or to the analysis of those questions? In other words, does each visualization have a purpose?
Are the legends, plot titles, axes labels, etc. clear and readable for the audience? For example, did
we make sure not to have ‘df1$y.variable’ as an axis label?
Are there terms (specifically, terms related to the project itself) that need to be clarified so that a
general audience can understand what we are saying?
Did we meet the lower and upper length limits for our report?
Did we underscore our motivations for asking the questions we did?
Did we summarize our findings in our report and underscore the implications of our findings?
Have we replaced any base R plots with more modern-looking visualizations?
Does our report look polished?
Has each person on the team discussed the Final Project in some depth with at least two people
outside of the class (not only to get feedback but also to understand what terms need to be clarified
for a general audience)?
Have we brainstormed our own questions on top of the questions above to ensure quality?
