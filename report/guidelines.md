Guidelines for Reports
Upon completing your analyses and creating relevant visualizations, you will create a written
report. Your report should inform the viewer as to why you conducted your study and what your
investigation sought to inform. Your findings should be clearly stated, and visualizations should
be relevant to your questions of interest. It should be clear how your work would help decision-
makers (the target audience of your study). It is best to coordinate on what to focus on in the report,
and it is a good idea if everyone reads through the final report to resolve any potential
misunderstandings. Typically, students will split the work on a project, so one or two team
members will know more about one section of the project than another. Before creating your
report, it is best to coordinate on what to focus on to deliver your message to the intended audience
of your report. You might not be able to go into all the details of every aspect of your project, so
you need to decide as a group what to highlight when writing your report.
For your final report, you may go into the technical details of your project. Due to space limitations
though, you may not be able to cover everything, so you have to think about what would be most
important for the audience to know in the core of the report and what details can be put in the
Appendix section (which does not count towards the page limit). If you can describe technical
elements at a high level without jargon, feel free to do. Otherwise, keep it in the Appendix. The
purpose of the report is to help your audience understand what you did and provide them with
insights that they can walk away with. It is not necessary to go into the technical details within the
written report. If you decide to go into technical details within your report, you should still aim to
make sure your audience can understand why you did what you did, what you investigated, what
you found (or created), and why those findings are important (or why those tools are useful).
The report should be at least ten pages double-spaced but no longer than twenty pages (not
counting the Title Page, Table of Contents, References, and Appendix). Figures and tables
won’t count toward the page limit either. The report should have the following: a Title Page, an
Introduction section, a Methodology section, a Results section, and a Discussion section. A Table
of Contents is optional, and you can feel free to include other sections to your report as well if you
want (for example, an Executive Summary or Future Research section). As in the presentation, the
Introduction contains the motivation and describes what you studied at a high level. The
Methodology section describes your data collection process and data source(s) as well as the
methodology (regression analysis, decision analysis, machine learning application, R Shiny app
creation, etc.). The Results section highlights the relevant results and the interpretation of those
results. The Discussion section discusses what are the main takeaways of the Results section
overall when all the findings or recommendations are taken together. This section discusses
recommendations you have for the decision-maker/audience of the report. Given the upper limit
on the page length, it is understandable if you cannot fit all of your work and findings into the
report. You will likely need to be selective of which aspects of the project to focus on. As long as
your questions and follow-up questions are present in your R code or visualization files, you will
not have points marked off for missing one or more of the six required questions within the report
