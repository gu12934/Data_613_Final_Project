Guidelines for the Final Project Presentation
Keep presentations between 15 to 25 minutes in length. Before going into the project details, you
need to first motivate the project and set the context for us. What questions did you ask in your
study? After giving us a high-level understanding of what the project is about and who would
benefit from your study, discuss your data collection process and your data sources (for each
question, if different questions have different data sources) before discussing the findings. After
you conclude, we will have a few minutes for Q&A. I will not be asking questions during your
talk or your Q&A unless it is to clarify a point I misunderstood or clarify something I did not hear.
All standard presentation tips and guidelines apply as in any other presentation setting.
If anyone on your team reads off of a script, their phone, their tablet, the computer screen, a piece
of paper, etc., then the highest grade your team can get on the presentation will be a B-.
Some Questions to Ask Yourselves When Preparing the Presentation:
In our presentation, have we underscored our motivations for asking the questions?
Have we discussed our data sources and data collection methods?
Have we summarized our findings and underscored the importance/implications of those findings?
Have we made sure that what we said is justified and correct?
Are the slides typo-free and error-free? Are the slides polished and nothing strange sticks out?
Have we asked people outside of the class to listen to a practice talk?
Is the introduction interesting and compelling enough to motivate the audience to listen?
Is the conclusion solid? Will the audience walk away thinking that they learned something valuable
or interesting to them?
Are we loud enough to hear from the back of the room?
Am I reading off of a script, my phone, my tablet, the screen, etc.?
You should come up with other questions on top of these to ensure a high-quality presentation
