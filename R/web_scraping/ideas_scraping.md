You can also satisfy this data collection requirement by automating the
collection of csv or JSON files across many different pages or over time to collect your data. In
essence, this skill should demonstrate some data collection skills that you did not have prior to
taking the class. Simply downloading a csv file from the web and importing it into R does not
count (since you may already have had that skill prior to taking the class). However, if you
automate the process in some way (via a for-loop or using a task scheduling tool to collect data
over time in an automated fashion), then that would satisfy the data collection requirement. You
can feel free supplement the data you obtain from this with data that you simply download from
other publicly available sources (such as csv files, JSON files, XML files, etc.). Packages that
might be useful are rvest, httr, XML, and RSelenium, and the PhantomJS tool might be useful too.
Examples of various data collection techniques are covered in the Automated Data Collection
textbook, and more examples are provided in the Web-Scraping subfolder on D2L
