⭐ 2. Time‑Series Forecasting Projects (Matches Interest‑Rate + Housing Trend Analysis)
📈 Store Sales – Time Series Forecasting
Shows:
ARIMA
SARIMA
Prophet
Lag features
Rolling windows
This is directly relevant because your project will likely involve:
Lagging interest rates
Forecasting housing prices
Testing responsiveness over time

⭐ 3. Macroeconomic + Financial Indicator Projects (Matches “Interest Rates → Housing” Causality)
💹 US Economic Indicators Dataset
Many notebooks analyze:
Inflation
Interest rates
Housing starts
GDP
Unemployment

These notebooks show how to:
Merge macroeconomic time series
Run correlation analysis
Build regression models with exogenous variables
Visualize long‑term trends
This is almost identical to workflow, just with US data instead of Alberta.

⭐ 4. Real Estate Market Analytics Projects (Matches Alberta Housing Component)
🏘 Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI) Projects
There are several notebooks analyzing:
Regional housing price trends
Price forecasting
Market comparisons
Time‑series decomposition
Even if you don’t use Zillow data, the analysis structure is exactly what you need.

⭐ 5. Interest Rate Sensitivity / Financial Modeling Projects
📊 Yield Curve + Interest Rate Modeling Projects
These notebooks show:
How to model interest rate changes
How to merge interest rates with other economic variables
How to test relationships statistically
This is directly relevant to your Bank of Canada rate series.

⭐ 6. Web‑Scraping + API Projects (Matches Data Collection Section)
You’ll find notebooks that use:
rvest
httr
jsonlite
API authentication
Data pipelines
These are great references for your data collection chapter.
