So the steps are:
1. make an rmd file and drop code in a google drive using web scraping links
2. after the scraping is done, do data transformations and cleaning
3. plot visualizations in R that are static
4. answer the problem questions with visualizations in analysis and discussion section
5. start doing report and figure out figure captions
6. this can be organized into the github repo into chunks or in 1 big file
7. lastly, make an interactive dashboard with the cleaned data into an tableau or powerbi file
8. take all the information and put into a presenation, and have a demo, screen recording of the visual


There are many other examples on using APIs with R.

There’s a new package called httr2 that can be used for APIs: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/httr2/vignettes/httr2.html and https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2023/11/httr2-1-0-0/
For JSON files in general, a nice video is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM.
